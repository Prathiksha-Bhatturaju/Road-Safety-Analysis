**Problem Statement: Road Safety Analysis**

Road safety authorities face the challenge of reducing accidents and casualties, but itâ€™s hard to know where, when, and why accidents happen most often. This project uses Power BI dashboards to explore ~139K accidents and ~4K casualties, helping to identify high-risk locations, peak accident times, vehicle types involved, and contributing factors. By visualizing these patterns, stakeholders can make better decisions to improve traffic management, allocate resources effectively, and implement targeted safety measures.

**Steps followed**
This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow for Uber trip data:

**1.Prerequisites & Setup:** Loaded raw accident data from Excel/CSV files into Power BI for analysis.

**2. Data Cleaning & Preparation:** Cleaned and standardized data, handled missing values, and ensured accuracy and consistency across all accident records.

**3. Data Modeling:** Built a data model with relationships, calendar tables, and measure tables to support accurate KPIs and time-based analysis.

**4. Reporting & Dashboards:** Developed 4 interactive dashboards:

**Severity Dashboard:** Total accidents and casualties, severity breakdown, vehicle involvement, speed limits, and road/light conditions.

**Time & Vehicle Dashboard:** Peak hours/days, monthly trends, vehicle-type analysis, and weekend vs. weekday patterns.

**Details Dashboard:** Record-level accident logs including accident date, vehicle type, severity, casualties, location, and contributing factors.

**Location Dashboard:** Geographic analysis highlighting accident hotspots by region/town/local authority.

**5. Deployment & Automation:** Published reports in Power BI Service with scheduled refreshes to maintain up-to-date insights.

**6. Documentation & Collaboration:** Shared project files, datasets, DAX measures, screenshots, and workflow on GitHub for reproducibility and learning.


**Overall Insights:**

1. Majority of accidents are slight, but serious and fatal accidents still contribute significantly to casualties.

2. Peak accidents occur at 5 PM, especially on Fridays.

3. Cars are the most involved vehicle type (~138K cases).

4. Urban areas and daylight conditions account for the majority of accidents.

5. Speed limits of 30 mph and 60 mph show the highest accident frequency.
